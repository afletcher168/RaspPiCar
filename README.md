# RaspPiCar
This code was made to be run on a Rasperberry Pi that is attatched to the car. The car was made as part of a kit sold by Yahboom.
The code itself is a mixture of code Yahboom wrote for the car, code that they wrote that I modified, and code that I wrote from scratch.
The specific program that contains most of what I learned is "MyTravelling.py".
